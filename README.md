# HackHub
A web-based portal for rolling out new community commission hackathons, HackHub provides a templated portal that can be rolled out for a variety of technology-oriented hackathons, whether start-up, student, or just general community-based.

## The Escalator Challenge
Escalator have opened HackHub up for forking to allow the coding community to build a solution that fits the needs of the community. The target of the first version should be an web application that allows for new hacking events to be rolled out, as single mission pages, on a scheduled basis, with permanent links that can hook in to the root repository and all subsequent applicant forks, enabling the final winning solution to be displayed at the end of the hackathon.

The first version should use this repository as the test data.

The code will be based on Node.js build processes and should used XHTML5 for semantic extensions, (if in doubt, use HTML5 with an XML declaration at the top!), allowing for easy parsing from third-party projects.		

Functionality could include:

 - Relational and / or document model database, (select carefully).
 - Secure login for event creators.
 - Markdown powered page for each new event using normalised URLs.
 - Support for GitHub repositories and forks.
 - Specification of "winning" fork.
 - Support for other repositories.
 - Support for internationalisation.
 - Support for localisation.
